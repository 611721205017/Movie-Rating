A movie rating website is an online platform where users can browse, rate, and review films. These websites typically provide a database of movies with details such as cast, crew, synopsis, and release date. Users can submit their ratings and reviews, which are aggregated to create an overall score or ranking for each film. Popular examples include IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. These sites often feature additional content like trailers, critic reviews, and user discussionÂ forums.
